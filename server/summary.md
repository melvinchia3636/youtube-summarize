The video is a tutorial on writing clean code in React,JS by a senior React developer. The developer shares their 8-year experience in writing clean code and provides step-by-step guidance on how to approach building a React application.

The video starts with a simple React application that contains a profile page with a list of user IDs. The task is to create a new page that will render when a user clicks on one of the IDs.

The developer creates a new folder called "pages" and inside it, a new file called "ProfilePage.tsx". The file is initialized with a `div` element and a class name "container" with styles to set a max-width and horizontal alignment.

Instead of keeping the styles in the ProfilePage component, the developer extracts them into a separate component called "PageLayout.tsx" in a new folder called "components". This component is a custom component that wraps the children with a div and applies the styles. This approach makes the code more scalable and reusable.

The developer then creates a new folder called "hooks" and inside it, a file called "useFetchProfile.ts" that contains a custom hook responsible for fetching the profile data based on the profile ID. This hook is reusable and can be used in other components that need to fetch profile data.

The developer then creates a new component called "ProfileData.tsx" that takes the profile data as a prop and is responsible for displaying the profile data. This component can be further divided into smaller sub-components, such as an "Avatar" component that displays the user's profile picture.

Throughout the video, the developer emphasizes the importance of separating concerns and responsibilities between components. Page components should only be responsible for rendering the overall layout, while feature components handle specific features, and UI components handle rendering individual UI elements.

The video concludes with the developer summarizing their approach to writing clean code in React, which involves delegating responsibilities to smaller components and using custom hooks and components to make the code more scalable and reusable.
